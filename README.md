Test_os
=======

This is just a simple project I have been working on, at the moment it is not even an OS. Most of the inspiration is from [JamesM's kernel development tutorials](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html) and [Alex Chadwick's Baking Pi tutorials](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/). Also, the Raspberry Pi is loaded from the UART via [raspbootin/raspbootcom](https://github.com/mrvn/raspbootin).

The next thing to do with the project would be:
* Virtual memory
* Memory allocation
* Improve English
* Improve typography

The last point should not be ignored, especially given that this whole project is also a (perhaps somewhat lacking) attempt at literate programming. It also needs typographic work as I am not really familiar with plain TeX or good typographic practices at the moment.
